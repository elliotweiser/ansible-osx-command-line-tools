# When defined to 0 (the default value), no timeout is applied.
# Depending on network conditions, Apple's service status, disk usage on the host, etc.,
# the softwareupdate tool may timeout. Commonly, rebooting or resetting certain settings
# on the host can fix this, but that is beyond the responsibility of this role.
